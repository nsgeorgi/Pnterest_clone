= Pinterest Style Web App
== Week 4 of my 12 in 12 Challenge

My goal with this challenge is to teach myself Ruby on Rails by building a new web app (using rails) each week for 12 weeks.

This week I built a Pinterest style web app, with Users, Pins, Image Uploading and all that good stuff!

{View the demo application here}[http://week-4-pin-board.herokuapp.com/], and watch the {How To Screencast here}[http://youtu.be/abcnfFS_DS8]
